# PROJECT NAME
React Shopping List 

## Description

_Duration: 2 Day Sprint_

This is a Prime Academy group project. Four fullstack engineering students created a shopping list web application.

This web application is able to input new items into the existing database, with their corresponding quantity and units. The web application also had the features to mark items as purchased, remove individual items from the list, and clear the entire items in the list.

The group of students worked on pair coding and organizing of equal work. Students also worked together remotely to plan and review several pull requests. Lastly, the students focused on AXIOS methodology using GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests to communicate between the server and client.
